                                <p>Pacific Rim Group was founded in early 2012 to change the dynamics of the real estate marketing industry. We realized that although there are many options and selections for graphic designers, marketers, project managers and advertising companies; there are not industry specialized marketers who understand the fundamentals of each industry. </p>

                                <p>We set out to revolutionize the industry, by bringing value and convenience back to our clients. We’ve been involved from start to finish in both large and small scale residential and commercial developments from community plans to boutique projects. As well, we’ve been involved in the marketing, branding, and promotion of many junior mining and resource companies. </p>

                                <p>We have experience with all steps of the process, including: project management, consulting, marketing packages, sales and after sales. </p>


                                <p>Beyond Creative— we interpret this in two ways. </p>

                                <p>1. Providing work that is more creative than just any creative agency. We look above and beyond to find a new concept that is customized to your project and speaks to its identity and brand. </p>

                                <p>2. Doing work that goes beyond the creative. We manage your projects to ensure that it is done right from every angle and ensure feasibility. This way, there are less headaches on our clients and they have the ease of knowing it is being done the right way. </p>

                                        <p>In our opinion, at least 80% of our time and resources should be spent in this stage. Understanding the target market is crucial in identifying a marketing strategy and marketing plan. Market research helps use budgets effectively and save money where possible. It answers questions for us like: </p>
                                        <blockquote>Who are we targeting? <br>
                                        What are the day to day trends of these people? What is lacking in the market place?<br>
                                        What is the optimal budget to target this market? Is there something to revolutionize or change given these trends?  </blockquote>

With a company in an area that has many past producing mines and in British Columbia, we felt that a more “homey” brand was appropriate. We decided to revamp the entire brand from scratch.

The company is a property management company of many high end exclusive properties so the brand itself should reflect that. We went with a modern and simplistic take on a building with a very urban feeling font. The west coast is a big part of a lifestyle and that is juxtaposed against a classy and elegant living in a less heavy font.</p>

We went very simple with clean lines and sharp images to display information clearly and appropriately. The website has been perfectly designed for an ideal user experience which makes finding your desired apartment an easy and enjoyable experience. From Craigslist ads, to application forms, to websites, to letterheads and business cards… we ensured the brand and identity was kept throughout the company.</p>

We decided to coin it “Guerrero’s Hidden Gem”, since the unique nature and strategic advantages of its sheer location. We decided to give this company a facelift right from scratch. From designing it’s logo, website, trade booth, presentations, print material and also assisting in it’s most recent and successful private placement,  we were and still are a crucial component to the success of Lucky Minerals to date. Pacific Rim Group even had a presence in Toronto’s PDAC to help and assist the team raising money.</p></div>

We decided to go with an entire new look for Acana Capital Corp. that is reflective of its corporate identity and acquisitions. The free form font that is bold and stands out is a symbol for its innovation and presence. Using a blue colour, which is very neutral, helps it to standout. Our minimalist look in the logo and clean lines is reflected through in the website. Although there is not much activity it is sophisticated, clean and a modern approach to an old industry of real estate, which is clearly and evidently , portrayed in the branding.</p>
